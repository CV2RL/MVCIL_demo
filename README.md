# MVCIL_demo
I dedicated my efforts to exploring two models, namely the ModelNet40 multi-view SOTA model PointView-GCN and the iCaRL model.<br>  
Additionally, I have reconstructed the dataset using PointView-GCN, and you can access it through this [single_view_modelnet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z-Te9Vw_PhQDCIc_zxyemwiBjI-BeBLK/view?usp=sharing).Please load and rename single_view_modelnet to \dataset\<br>
